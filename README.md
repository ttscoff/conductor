# Sample config for Marked Conductor

This repo is my actual setup for [Conductor](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/conductor). It's a work in progress; I'm still dissecting the jekyll-pre script that built up over the last 10 years and contains a bunch of conditional statements that need to be moved into individual scripts triggered by Conductor conditions. But this should give you an idea how to set it up.
